    <h1> Assignment 2 </h1>
    <p> Recently blizzard released overwatch 2. As an overwatch player I was excited, however
      the rank system is done so <strong> poorly </strong> that it isn't as fun as overwatch 1. I can also not go
      back to overwatch 1 because they took it away when they released 2.
